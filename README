 About Clazzy
=================

Clazzy is a code generation platform, which focuses on handling 
class definition syntax for the user in a variety of programming langauges.

By writing a straight-forward description of a high-level class design,
Clazzy will generate code in a number of user-specified programming
languages with "TODO" comments in function bodies.

This allows developers to quickly set up a multi-language project without
having to shift between language syntaxes for the boiler-plate class
definitions.  This avoids typos between projects, prevents compile-time errors
for simple syntax issues, and most importantly saves time.

=====================
 Supported Languages
=====================
Clazzy can generate code for:

    C++
    C
    Java
    Python

 Compiling

If you haven't changed any of the code, you should be able to simply run:

    make

If you have changed the code, you may need to have flex++ installed, but 
the same process will work.

 Classes
=========

---------
 Parsing
---------

parser:
    Implements functions corresponding to the grammar rules below (in 
    recusive descent fashion) that uses FlexParser to read input.
    
    Contains a vector of class-def's and an array of languages it will 
    generate.

---------------
 Data Modeling
---------------

class_def:
    Represents a class definition.

    Contains a vector of functions and another of members.

function:
    Represents a function declaration.

    Contains a map from function names to parameter names.

member:
    Represenets a class member.

    Contains a name.

-----------
 Languages
-----------

langauge:
    An abstract class meant to be extended for plugging in new languages.

language_factory:
    A class with a single static method, with acts as a bridge between
    the parser and the language implementations themselves.
