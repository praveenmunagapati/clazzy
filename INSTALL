 Building and Installing clazzy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install clazzy, ensure that you have a recent version of g++ (or a C++ 
compiler with C++11 support) and the make utility.

Run the following commands as root:

    make
    make install

Alternatively, if you have makepkg available, you can simple use build/PKGBUILD
to make and install clazzy:

    cd build/
    makepkg
