cranberry
=========

A semi-natural-language code generation platform for projects that need similar data structures in multiple languages.

Cranberry is an open source C++ program licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

The executable itself is a compiler from a its own high level class definition language 
into a variety of actual programming languages.  Using cranberry, you can define a similar structure
for use in multiple application, on multiple platforms, and only having to worry about the actual
implementation of functions.


Architecture
------------
Cranberry is structured as a recursive-descent parser, fed by tokens generated by flex, which generate an intermediate
representation that is passed to one or more code generators for different languages.

The grammar and token definitions for cranberry can be found in the accompanying README file, as well as the list of
supported langauges and features.

Dependencies
------------
Cranberry is written in C++11 and has no external dependancies. Some of the code is generated with
flex, a lexical analyser, but the generated code should compile with any C++11 compiler.

Though the Makefile used is fairly general, the build process is still somewhat geared more for a UNIX-based
system, and only officially tested in a Linux/Gnu Make environment.
